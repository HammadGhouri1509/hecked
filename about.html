    <p>Havana is the capital city of Cuba and is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and colorful streets. The city features beautiful Spanish colonial architecture, especially in Old Havana, a UNESCO World Heritage Site with cobblestone streets and historic plazas. Classic cars from the 1950s, lively music, and street art give Havana a unique and energetic atmosphere. The Malecón, a famous seaside boulevard, is a popular gathering place where people enjoy ocean views and sunsets. Havana reflects Cuba’s cultural pride through its music, dance, food, and strong sense of community.</p>
